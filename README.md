# Overview
Rboxlo is an open source decentralized Roblox private server framework, by the people, for the people. Rboxlo is for the individual in that anybody can clone its source code and set up their own private instance. Rboxlo has no ads, has no copyright and has all its source code dedicated to the public domain.

Currently, Rboxlo is not a finished project-- it is a constant work in progress. Do not expect everything from Roblox to be imported on Rboxlo just yet. Rboxlo is still in its infancy.

Rboxlo was created with the intention of allowing anybody to play Roblox games privately without restrictions imposed by anybody but yourself, making it the ultimate free Roblox private server.

Some distinct features about Rboxlo:
- Decentralized, anybody can set up their own instance
- Modern codebase with Docker containerization and optimized, fast, and secure code
- Easy to set up
- Public domain software, copyright-free
- No corporate fellows telling you what is and what isn't allowed
- You can set up your own community in a matter of seconds
- Open source
- ... and so much more to come!

# Copyright
## License
This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain. The full Rboxlo license is available [here](https://github.com/lightbulblighter/Rboxlo/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Roblox Copyrighted Content
No Roblox copyrighted works can be found on here, besides parodies of the official Roblox logo (but falls under Fair Use.) You cannot find any Roblox game executables here. All API endpoints are reverse-engineered from the Roblox API endpoints, meaning that we take the output from the endpoint and try to figure out the technology that generates such result to make it work with the Roblox clients standalone from the Roblox website. No Roblox source code has been used to assist the development of Rboxlo.

The design of Rboxlo makes it so that all you need to set it up is this repository and decent computer knowledge. There is no possible way that Roblox can, all at once, shut down every single instance of Rboxlo living on the internet. If you are worried about Roblox hunting you down, do not advertise your instance of Rboxlo.
